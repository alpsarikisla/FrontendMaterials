<h1 id="animations">Animations</h1>
<p>AngularJS provides animation hooks for common directives such as
<a href="api/ng/directive/ngRepeat">ngRepeat</a>, <a href="api/ng/directive/ngSwitch">ngSwitch</a>, and
<a href="api/ngRoute/directive/ngView">ngView</a>, as well as custom directives via the <code>$animate</code> service.
These animation hooks are set in place to trigger animations during the life cycle of various
directives and when triggered, will attempt to perform a CSS Transition, CSS Keyframe Animation or a
JavaScript callback Animation (depending on whether an animation is placed on the given directive).
Animations can be placed using vanilla CSS by following the naming conventions set in place by
AngularJS or with JavaScript code, defined as a factory.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
  Note that we have used non-prefixed CSS transition properties in our examples as the major
  browsers now support non-prefixed properties. If you intend to support older browsers or certain
  mobile browsers then you will need to include prefixed versions of the transition properties. Take
  a look at <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions">http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-transitions</a> for what browsers require prefixes, and
  <a href="https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer">https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer</a> for a tool that can automatically generate the prefixes
  for you.

<p>Animations are not available unless you include the <a href="api/ngAnimate"><code>ngAnimate</code> module</a> as a
dependency of your application.</p>
<p>Below is a quick example of animations being enabled for <code>ngShow</code> and <code>ngHide</code>:</p>
<p>

</p>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>See the <a href="api/ngAnimate">API docs for <code>ngAnimate</code></a> for instructions on installing the module.</p>
<p>You may also want to setup a separate CSS file for defining CSS-based animations.</p>
<h2 id="how-they-work">How they work</h2>
<p>Animations in AngularJS are completely based on CSS classes. As long as you have a CSS class
attached to an HTML element within your application, you can apply animations to it. Let&#39;s say for
example that we have an HTML template with a repeater like so:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-repeat=&quot;item in items&quot; class=&quot;repeated-item&quot;&gt;
  {{ item.id }}
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>repeated-item</code> class is present on the element that will be repeated and this
class will be used as a reference within our application&#39;s CSS and/or JavaScript animation code to
tell AngularJS to perform an animation.</p>
<p>As <code>ngRepeat</code> does its thing, each time a new item is added into the list, <code>ngRepeat</code> will add an
<code>ng-enter</code> class to the element that is being added. When removed it will apply an <code>ng-leave</code> class
and when moved around it will apply an <code>ng-move</code> class.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the following CSS code, we can see some transition and keyframe animation code set
up for each of those events that occur when <code>ngRepeat</code> triggers them:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/*
  We are using CSS transitions for when the enter and move events
  are triggered for the element that has the `repeated-item` class
*/
.repeated-item.ng-enter, .repeated-item.ng-move {
  transition: all 0.5s linear;
  opacity: 0;
}

/*
  `.ng-enter-active` and `.ng-move-active` are where the transition destination
  properties are set so that the animation knows what to animate
*/
.repeated-item.ng-enter.ng-enter-active,
.repeated-item.ng-move.ng-move-active {
  opacity: 1;
}

/*
  We are using CSS keyframe animations for when the `leave` event
  is triggered for the element that has the `repeated-item` class
*/
.repeated-item.ng-leave {
  animation: 0.5s my_animation;
}

@keyframes my_animation {
  from { opacity: 1; }
  to   { opacity: 0; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The same approach to animation can be used using JavaScript code
(<strong>for simplicity, we rely on jQuery to perform animations here</strong>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.animation(&#39;.repeated-item&#39;, function() {
  return {
    enter: function(element, done) {
      // Initialize the element&#39;s opacity
      element.css(&#39;opacity&#39;, 0);

      // Animate the element&#39;s opacity
      // (`element.animate()` is provided by jQuery)
      element.animate({opacity: 1}, done);

      // Optional `onDone`/`onCancel` callback function
      // to handle any post-animation cleanup operations
      return function(isCancelled) {
        if (isCancelled) {
          // Abort the animation if cancelled
          // (`element.stop()` is provided by jQuery)
          element.stop();
        }
      };
    },
    leave: function(element, done) {
      // Initialize the element&#39;s opacity
      element.css(&#39;opacity&#39;, 1);

      // Animate the element&#39;s opacity
      // (`element.animate()` is provided by jQuery)
      element.animate({opacity: 0}, done);

      // Optional `onDone`/`onCancel` callback function
      // to handle any post-animation cleanup operations
      return function(isCancelled) {
        if (isCancelled) {
          // Abort the animation if cancelled
          // (`element.stop()` is provided by jQuery)
          element.stop();
        }
      };
    },

    // We can also capture the following animation events:
    move: function(element, done) {},
    addClass: function(element, className, done) {},
    removeClass: function(element, className, done) {}
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>With these generated CSS class names present on the element at the time, AngularJS automatically
figures out whether to perform a CSS and/or JavaScript animation. Note that you can&#39;t have both CSS
and JavaScript animations based on the same CSS class. See
<a href="api/ngAnimate#css-js-animations-together">here</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="class-and-ngclass-animation-hooks">Class and <code>ngClass</code> animation hooks</h2>
<p>AngularJS also pays attention to CSS class changes on elements by triggering the <strong>add</strong> and
<strong>remove</strong> hooks. This means that if a CSS class is added to or removed from an element then an
animation can be executed in between, before the CSS class addition or removal is finalized.
(Keep in mind that AngularJS will only be able to capture class changes if an
<strong>interpolated expression</strong> or the <strong>ng-class</strong> directive is used on the element.)</p>
<p>The example below shows how to perform animations during class changes:</p>
<p>

<div>
  <plnkr-opener example-path="examples/example-animate-css-class"></plnkr-opener>

  <div class="runnable-example"
      path="examples/example-animate-css-class"
      module="ngAnimate"
      deps="angular-animate.js"
      animations="true"
      name="animate-css-class">

  
    <div class="runnable-example-file" 
      name="index.html"
      language="html"
      type="html">
      <pre><code>&lt;p&gt;&#10;  &lt;button ng-click=&quot;myCssVar=&#39;css-class&#39;&quot;&gt;Set&lt;/button&gt;&#10;  &lt;button ng-click=&quot;myCssVar=&#39;&#39;&quot;&gt;Clear&lt;/button&gt;&#10;  &lt;br&gt;&#10;  &lt;span ng-class=&quot;myCssVar&quot;&gt;CSS-Animated Text&lt;/span&gt;&#10;&lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>
    </div>
  
    <div class="runnable-example-file" 
      name="style.css"
      language="css"
      type="css">
      <pre><code>.css-class-add, .css-class-remove {&#10;  transition: all 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.250, 0.460, 0.450, 0.940);&#10;}&#10;&#10;.css-class,&#10;.css-class-add.css-class-add-active {&#10;  color: red;&#10;  font-size: 3em;&#10;}&#10;&#10;.css-class-remove.css-class-remove-active {&#10;  font-size: 1em;&#10;  color: black;&#10;}</code></pre>
    </div>
  

    <iframe class="runnable-example-frame" src="examples/example-animate-css-class/index.html" name="example-animate-css-class"></iframe>
  </div>
</div>


</p>
<p>Although the CSS is a little different than what we saw before, the idea is the same.</p>
<h2 id="which-directives-support-animations-">Which directives support animations?</h2>
<p>A handful of common AngularJS directives support and trigger animation hooks whenever any major
event occurs during their life cycle. The table below explains in detail which animation events are
triggered:</p>

<p>For a full breakdown of the steps involved during each animation event, refer to the
<a href="api/ng/service/$animate"><code>$animate</code> API docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-use-animations-in-my-own-directives-">How do I use animations in my own directives?</h2>
<p>Animations within custom directives can also be established by injecting <code>$animate</code> directly into
your directive and making calls to it when needed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.directive(&#39;my-directive&#39;, [&#39;$animate&#39;, function($animate) {
  return function(scope, element) {
    element.on(&#39;click&#39;, function() {
      if (element.hasClass(&#39;clicked&#39;)) {
        $animate.removeClass(element, &#39;clicked&#39;);
      } else {
        $animate.addClass(element, &#39;clicked&#39;);
      }
    });
  };
}]);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="animations-on-app-bootstrap-page-load">Animations on app bootstrap / page load</h2>
<p>By default, animations are disabled when the AngularJS app <a href="guide/bootstrap">bootstraps</a>. If you
are using the <a href="api/ng/directive/ngApp"><code>ngApp</code></a> directive, this happens in the <code>DOMContentLoaded</code> event, so immediately
after the page has been loaded. Animations are disabled, so that UI and content are instantly
visible. Otherwise, with many animations on the page, the loading process may become too visually
overwhelming, and the performance may suffer.</p>
<p>Internally, <code>ngAnimate</code> waits until all template downloads that are started right after bootstrap
have finished. Then, it waits for the currently running <a href="api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$digest">$digest</a>
and one more after that, to finish. This ensures that the whole app has been compiled fully before
animations are attempted.</p>
<p>If you do want your animations to play when the app bootstraps, you can enable animations globally
in your main module&#39;s <a href="api/ng/type/angular.Module#run">run</a> function:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">myModule.run(function($animate) {
  $animate.enabled(true);
});
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-to-selectively-enable-disable-and-skip-animations">How to (selectively) enable, disable and skip animations</h2>
<p>There are several different ways to disable animations, both globally and for specific animations.
Disabling specific animations can help to speed up the render performance, for example for large
<code>ngRepeat</code> lists that don&#39;t actually have animations. Because <code>ngAnimate</code> checks at runtime if
animations are present, performance will take a hit even if an element has no animation.</p>
<h3 id="during-the-config-link-animateprovider-customfilter-animateprovider-customfilter-">During the config: <a href="api/ng/provider/$animateProvider#customFilter">$animateProvider.customFilter()</a></h3>
<p>This function can be called during the <a href="api/ng/type/angular.Module#config">config</a> phase of an app. It
takes a filter function as the only argument, which will then be used to &quot;filter&quot; animations (based
on the animated element, the event type, and the animation options). Only when the filter function
returns <code>true</code>, will the animation be performed. This allows great flexibility - you can easily
create complex rules, such as allowing specific events only or enabling animations on specific
subtrees of the DOM, and dynamically modify them, for example disabling animations at certain points
in time or under certain circumstances.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">app.config(function($animateProvider) {
  $animateProvider.customFilter(function(node, event, options) {
    // Example: Only animate `enter` and `leave` operations.
    return event === &#39;enter&#39; || event === &#39;leave&#39;;
  });
});
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>customFilter</code> approach generally gives a big speed boost compared to other strategies, because
the matching is done before other animation disabling strategies are checked.</p>
<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>Best Practice:</strong>
  Keep the filtering function as lean as possible, because it will be called for each DOM
  action (e.g. insertion, removal, class change) performed by &quot;animation-aware&quot; directives.
  See <a href="guide/animations#which-directives-support-animations-">here</a> for a list of built-in
  directives that support animations.
  Performing computationally expensive or time-consuming operations on each call of the
  filtering function can make your animations sluggish.
</div>

<h3 id="during-the-config-link-animateprovider-classnamefilter-animateprovider-classnamefilter-">During the config: <a href="api/ng/provider/$animateProvider#classNameFilter">$animateProvider.classNameFilter()</a></h3>
<p>This function too can be called during the <a href="api/ng/type/angular.Module#config">config</a> phase of an app. It
takes a regex as the only argument, which will then be matched against the classes of any element
that is about to be animated. The regex allows a lot of flexibility - you can either allow
animations for specific classes only (useful when you are working with 3rd party animations), or
exclude specific classes from getting animated.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-js">app.config(function($animateProvider) {
  $animateProvider.classNameFilter(/animate-/);
});
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-css">/* prefixed with `animate-` */
.animate-fade-add.animate-fade-add-active {
  transition: all 1s linear;
  opacity: 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>classNameFilter</code> approach generally gives a big speed boost compared to other strategies,
because the matching is done before other animation disabling strategies are checked. However, that
also means it is not possible to override class name matching with the two following strategies.
It&#39;s of course still possible to enable / disable animations by changing an element&#39;s class name at
runtime.</p>
<h3 id="at-runtime-link-ng-animate-enabled-animate-enabled-">At runtime: <a href="api/ng/service/$animate#enabled">$animate.enabled()</a></h3>
<p>This function can be used to enable / disable animations in two different ways:</p>
<p>With a single <code>boolean</code> argument, it enables / disables animations globally:
<code>$animate.enabled(false)</code> disables all animations in your app.</p>
<p>When the first argument is a native DOM or jqLite/jQuery element, the function enables / disables
animations on this element <em>and all its children</em>: <code>$animate.enabled(myElement, false)</code>. You can
still use it to re-enable animations for a child element, even if you have disabled them on a parent
element. And compared to the <code>classNameFilter</code>, you can change the animation status at runtime
instead of during the config phase.</p>
<p>Note however that the <code>$animate.enabled()</code> state for individual elements does not overwrite
disabling rules that have been set in the <a href="api/ng/provider/$animateProvider#classNameFilter">classNameFilter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="via-css-styles-overwriting-styles-in-the-ng-animate-css-class">Via CSS styles: overwriting styles in the <code>ng-animate</code> CSS class</h3>
<p>Whenever an animation is started, <code>ngAnimate</code> applies the <code>ng-animate</code> class to the element for the
whole duration of the animation. By applying CSS transition / animation styling to that class, you
can skip an animation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.my-class {
  transition: transform 2s;
}

.my-class:hover {
  transform: translateX(50px);
}

my-class.ng-animate {
  transition: 0s;
}
</code></pre>
<p>By setting <code>transition: 0s</code>, <code>ngAnimate</code> will ignore the existing transition styles, and not try to
animate them (Javascript animations will still execute, though). This can be used to prevent
<a href="guide/animations#preventing-collisions-with-existing-animations-and-third-party-libraries">issues with existing animations interfering with <code>ngAnimate</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="preventing-flicker-before-an-animation-starts">Preventing flicker before an animation starts</h2>
<p>When nesting elements with structural animations, such as <code>ngIf</code>, into elements that have
class-based animations such as <code>ngClass</code>, it sometimes happens that before the actual animation
starts, there is a brief flicker or flash of content where the animated element is briefly visible.</p>
<p>To prevent this, you can apply styles to the <code>ng-[event]-prepare</code> class, which is added as soon as
an animation is initialized, but removed before the actual animation starts (after waiting for a
<code>$digest</code>). This class is only added for <em>structural</em> animations (<code>enter</code>, <code>move</code>, and <code>leave</code>).</p>
<p>Here&#39;s an example where you might see flickering:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;div ng-class=&quot;{red: myProp}&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div ng-class=&quot;{blue: myProp}&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;message&quot; ng-if=&quot;myProp&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>It is possible that during the <code>enter</code> event, the <code>.message</code> div will be briefly visible before it
starts animating. In that case, you can add styles to the CSS that make sure the element stays
hidden before the animation starts:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.message.ng-enter-prepare {
  opacity: 0;
}

/* Other animation styles ... */
</code></pre>
<h2 id="preventing-collisions-with-existing-animations-and-third-party-libraries">Preventing collisions with existing animations and third-party libraries</h2>
<p>By default, any <code>ngAnimate</code>-enabled directives will assume that <code>transition</code> / <code>animation</code> styles on
the element are part of an <code>ngAnimate</code> animation. This can lead to problems when the styles are
actually for animations that are independent of <code>ngAnimate</code>.</p>
<p>For example, an element acts as a loading spinner. It has an infinite css animation on it, and also
an <a href="api/ng/directive/ngIf"><code>ngIf</code></a> directive, for which no animations are defined:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.spinner {
  animation: rotating 2s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes rotating {
  from { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when the <code>ngIf</code> expression changes, <code>ngAnimate</code> will see the spinner animation and use it to
animate the <code>enter</code>/<code>leave</code> event, which doesn&#39;t work because the animation is infinite. The element
will still be added / removed after a timeout, but there will be a noticeable delay.</p>
<p>This might also happen because some third-party frameworks place animation duration defaults across
many element or className selectors in order to make their code small and reusable.</p>
<p>You can prevent this unwanted behavior by adding CSS to the <code>.ng-animate</code> class, that is added for
the whole duration of each animation. Simply overwrite the transition / animation duration. In the
case of the spinner, this would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-css">.spinner.ng-animate {
  animation: 0s none;
  transition: 0s none;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you do have CSS transitions / animations defined for the animation events, make sure they have a
higher priority than any styles that are not related to <code>ngAnimate</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use one of the other
<a href="guide/animations#how-to-selectively-enable-disable-and-skip-animations">strategies to disable animations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="enable-animations-outside-of-the-application-dom-tree-link-ng-animate-pin-animate-pin-">Enable animations outside of the application DOM tree: <a href="api/ng/service/$animate#pin">$animate.pin()</a></h2>
<p>Before animating, <code>ngAnimate</code> checks if the animated element is inside the application DOM tree. If
not, no animation is run. Usually, this is not a problem since most apps use the <code>html</code> or <code>body</code>
elements as their root.</p>
<p>Problems arise when the application is bootstrapped on a different element, and animations are
attempted on elements that are outside the application tree, e.g. when libraries append popup or
modal elements to the body tag.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="api/ng/service/$animate#pin"><code>$animate.pin(element, parentHost)</code></a> to associate an element with
another element that belongs to your application. Simply call it before the element is added to the
DOM / before the animation starts, with the element you want to animate, and the element which
should be its assumed parent.</p>

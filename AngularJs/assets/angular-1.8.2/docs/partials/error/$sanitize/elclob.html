<h2 id="description">Description</h2>
<div class="description">
  <p>This error occurs when <code>$sanitize</code> sanitizer is unable to traverse the HTML because one or more of the elements in the
HTML have been &quot;clobbered&quot;. This could be a sign that the payload contains code attempting to cause a DoS attack on the
browser.</p>
<p>Typically clobbering breaks the <code>nextSibling</code> property on an element so that it points to one of its child nodes. This
makes it impossible to walk the HTML tree without getting stuck in an infinite loop, which causes the browser to freeze.</p>
